## Introduction | TL;DR

**Superwarden is the first decentralized, off-chain, gasless governance and voting platform that is specially built for TRON-based DAOs.** It allows DAOs to build their own community townhall with custom branding, and manage their DAO activity in just one platform with a role-based management system. With its powerful and comprehensive voting system and built-in strategies, DAOs can set up and run their proposal voting dynamically with advanced customization. DAO members can easily participate in proposal voting on Superwarden, as the voting user interface is designed to be user-friendly (even for a complete novice in blockchain space). Furthermore, Superwarden's announcement broadcasting system also helps townhall community members to keep track of DAO activities efficiently. 

> ðŸ’¡ In short, Superwarden is a powerful and comprehensive solution when comes to governance & voting in the TRON ecosystem. Now, it is **live on the TRON mainnet** and becoming the go-to choice for TRON-based DAOs!

##### ðŸ”» Core attributes

* **Decentralized**: Proposals, voting results and voters list, as well as DAO announcements, are fully stored on decentralized Web3.0 storage - IPFS (with the help of Web3.Storage and Pinata). Making everything easy to verify and hard to contest.

* **Off-chain**: All the activities in Superwarden are hosted off-chain to greatly reduce the cost of powering DAO activities with blockchain. However, we are interacting with data on the TRON blockchain and everything is decentralized and transparent. That's why TRC-10, TRC-20, and TRC-721 can be fully utilized for governance and voting purposes at Superwarden.

* **Gasless**: Say no to the high cost of gas fee! TRON-based DAOs can operate and run all the activities without any gas fee (free). There is also no burden for the community members to take part in DAO activities.

* **Open-Source with MIT license**: What does it mean when it is open-source and everyone can contribute to it? DAOs can build their own voting systems or features for certain purposes, and use them on Superwarden. It has endless possibilities and growing fast!
